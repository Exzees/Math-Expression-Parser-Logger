Math Expression Parser Module
Overview
A Python module that provides mathematical expression parsing functionality with operation logging. The module can be imported and used in other projects for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions while maintaining a history of all operations.


Features
Mathematical expression parsing and evaluation

Support for basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, //, **, %

Automatic logging of all operations to JSON file

Error handling for division by zero and invalid expressions

Floating-point number support

Cross-platform file path handling


Installation
No additional dependencies required. Uses only standard Python libraries:

datetime

json

pathlib


Error Handling
The function handles common errors:

Division by zero: Prints error message and continues

Invalid expressions: Returns None and prints "numslots is empty"

JSON file corruption: Automatically recovers and creates new file


Notes
The module maintains state through the JSON log file

All operations are persisted across sessions

The function is thread-safe for basic usage

For production use, consider adding additional error handling and validation
